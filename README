PyBot Framework README
=====================

This framework contains three python files.

	-robot.py
	-botwrapper.py
	-testmovement.py

robot.py:
	Robot.py is the backend class file containing the robot class and 
	direction constants

botwrapper.py:
	This contains functions for easily manipulating a single robot and 
	graphically displaying it on a map

testmovement.py:
	This is an example program showing off a series of turns and moves
	with brief pauses between each action

PyBot Framework Usage -- botwrapper.py
==================================

The recommended usage of PyBot is via botwrapper.py. To use botwrapper, import
it and access its functions.

Botwrapper defines the following functions:

turnLeft()
turnRight()
move(dist)
getX()
getY()
getDir() 	- Returns int constant for direction. Used behind the scenes
getDirS()	- Returns the direction in a string
inTrail(point)	- Returns true if a tuple point is in the trail.
printMap()

In addition, botwrapper defines the following constants:

UP
DOWN
LEFT
RIGHT

and the following variables

trail
bot

The variable bot is initialized to a robot.Robot()

If you take care to avoid name conflicts, you can safely 

	from botwrapper import *

and call the functions without prefixing botwrapper.

For example:

	from botwrapper import *

	turnLeft()
	move(5)
	printMap()

If you do now wish to import *, you can simply import botwrapper. Note that you
will need to prefix each botwrapper function with botwrapper. should you choose
to do this:

	import botwrapper

	botwrapper.turnLeft()
	botwrapper.move(5)
	botwrapper.printMap()

The example testmovement.py uses the former method, which is also recommended
to save typing in an interactive session.

PyBot Framework Usage -- robot
=============================

robot.py is the object-oriented backend to botwrapper. It provides an advanced
way to use the PyBot Framework. It is necessary to do fun stuff like manage
multiple robots. 

The primary purpose of robot.py is to define the Robot class. You can access 
this class directly by importing the module robot:

	import robot
	bot = robot.Robot

The robot module is imported indirectly by botwrapper.

The robot module also defines class Direction. This class simply contains four
constants reprenenting direction:
	
	Direction.UP
	Direction.DOWN
	Direction.LEFT
	Direction.RIGHT

The Robot class has several methods and values:

posX
posY
direction

checkBounds(bounds)
move(dist)
turnLeft()
turnRight()
getPos()

checkBounds(bounds) - Pass a 4-element tuple to checkBounds in the form (xmin,
ymin, xmax, ymax) and it will constrain and revert the robot to those bounds.

getPos() - returns a two-element tuple in the form (posX, posY)

Upon initialization, a Robot "spawns" at (0,0)
